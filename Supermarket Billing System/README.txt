First C++ project to get a better understanding of the OOPS concept.
The syntax used is pretty common to keep it simple, but further, I will modify the same code using Data Structures and advanced C++.

The project is based on the billing system of the Supermarket.
Every function across the billing system, including administrator login to customer checkout with receipt, is carried out smoothly with the proper explanation at the terminal.

The project concept is taken entirely from the Simplilearn youtube channel.
This code can be used as the source code for that video.

PS: The code is still in the modifying stage. I am just creating a repo to better understand GIT and GitHub.
